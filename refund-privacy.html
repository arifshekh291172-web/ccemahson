        <h1>Refund Policy</h1>
        <p class="muted">Last updated: January 2025</p>

        <p>
            At <b>CCE Mahson</b>, we believe in transparency and fairness.
            This Refund Policy explains when a refund may or may not be applicable.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Accidental / Wrong Payment</h3>
        <p>
            If a payment is made <b>accidentally</b> (for example, wrong amount,
            duplicate transaction, or technical error), the student is eligible
            for a <b>full refund</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
            To be eligible, the refund request must be raised within
            <b>24 hours</b> of the transaction with valid proof.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Multiple Accidental Payments</h3>
        <p>
            If accidental payments occur multiple times, refunds will be provided
            for up to <b>three (3) accidental transactions</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Repeated misuse beyond this limit may result in rejection of further
            refund requests.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Course Change of Mind</h3>
        <p>
            If a student enrolls in a course and later decides not to continue
            due to a <b>change of mind or personal preference</b>,
            <b>no refund will be provided</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Students are advised to carefully review course details, duration,
            and fees before making a payment.
        </p>

        <h3>4. Course Access & Usage</h3>
        <p>
            Once course access, study material, or certification process has
            started, the payment becomes <b>non-refundable</b>.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Refund Processing Time</h3>
        <p>
            Approved refunds will be processed within
            <b>7–10 working days</b> to the original payment method.
        </p>
